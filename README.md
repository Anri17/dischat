# Dischat [English/Inglês] 

## Introduction
This application was done in context of my internship. The goal was to make a simple chat application that would allow a user to register a username, email and password, store them into a database and allow the user to login with his email and password. Then he would pre redirected to a interface with a chat, consisting of a text from and a div with all the messages, and the user list of online and offline users. Messages would be sent and updated in real time to everyone online, and stored into a database for loading when the users logged in.

## To Run The Application
1. install node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/ (Install the recommended version. Should be the button on the left)
2. Install mongodb on https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community - There are 3 option you must choose before downloading. First choose the version (I recomend you choose the current version displayed). Then select your operating system (It will probably be windows). Finally change your package to MSI (recomended).
3. Download the project and place it into the directoyou you most desire.
4. Install the dependecies and frameworks I used for the project - To install them open your command line, navigate to the project's folder and execute the command ```npm install```. A progress indicator will show up in your command line showing all the dependencies being installed. The process will be finished when the command line cursor shows up again.
5. To run the server, make sure you're still in the project's directory in the command line and execute the command ```node app.js```. The server will be running.
6. To access the application, open your browser and open the following link https://localhost:4000
